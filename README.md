"When we speak of man and space, it sounds as though man stood on one side, space on the other. Yet space is not something that faces man. It is neither an external object nor an inner experience. It is not that there are men, and over and above them space, for when I say a man (...), I already name the stay within the fourfold among things." 

- M. Heidegger
